# Question: 
**Would this still work if the tweet_list is empty?**
```python
def display_up_to_n_most_recent_tweets(cursor, tweets_list, n):
    index = 0
    status = True
    while status:
        for i in tweets_list[index:index+n]:
            print(i)
```
# Answer: 
Yes, the function will still work if `tweet_list` is empty. In Python, an empty list is a valid iterable, so you can loop over it without any issues. However, since there are no elements in the list, the body of the loop won't be executed.

In your case, if `tweet_list` is empty, the `for i in tweets_list[index:index+n]:` loop will not execute, and the function will immediately ask for user input with `userin = input("type one of the following: next, prev, q: ")`. If the user enters "next" or "prev", the function will print "No more next" or "No more previous" respectively, because `(index+n) < len(tweets_list)` and `(index-n) > 0` will both be False when `tweets_list` is empty. If the user enters "q", the function will print "Exiting.." and `status` will be set to False, ending the while loop. If the user enters anything else, the function will print "Invalid output". 

So, the function will not throw an error with an empty `tweet_list`, but it may not behave as expected, since there are no tweets to display. You might want to add a check at the beginning of your function to handle this case specifically, like so:

```python
def display_up_to_n_most_recent_tweets(cursor, tweets_list, n):
    if not tweets_list:
        print("No tweets to display.")
        return False  # return False to indicate that the function should not continue running

    # rest of your code...
```

This way, the function will immediately exit and print a message if `tweets_list` is empty. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. ðŸ˜Š
